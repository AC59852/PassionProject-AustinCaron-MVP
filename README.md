# üßê Project philosophy

> Toksan-Wiki was created as a tool to help users find simple, easy to understand information about their favourite characters without the need of constant scrolling through content that feels meaningless, or just unneccesary.
> 
> The content is based off of another project called [Toksan Anime](https://ac59852.github.io/toksan-anime). This site was created as a showcase my own, and a friend/colleagues ever-growing skillset, as well as our passion for anime. I wanted to develop the concept further and create a place to learn more specifically about characters instead of the anime.

# üìí Features

This project features a fully responsive layout for all screen sizes (up to desktop 1080p), dynamic routing for each anime/character, one-to-many relational database for relating characters to anime, a fully functioning CRUD system for adding, updating, and removing both animes' and characters, and extra small features such as tactile feedback for hovering over content, as well as a modern user interface.

# üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack

Here's a brief overview of the tech stack Toksan-Wiki uses:

- This project uses the [ASP.NET framework](https://asp.net/) for C#. .NET is a developer platform made up of tools, programming languages, and libraries for building many different types of applications.
- For persistent storage (database), the app uses the built-in SQL Server system that is installed with Visual Studio. This allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
- The web app uses the fonts ["IBM Plex Sans"]([https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans) and [
Barlow](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Barlow) as the font-families for headings and paragraph text respectively.
- On top of these tools, pages are rendered using HTML5, styled using CSS3, and custom scripts using JavaScript. These tools allow for powerful client-side applications such as click events and others.
